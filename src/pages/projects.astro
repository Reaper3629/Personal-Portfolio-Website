                            Hello! Welcome again! I knew that going into university, I would need to be prepared for the new challenges 
                            and developments I would encounter. So, I thought it would be a fun venture to learn how to make a website 
                            to track and document the projects I want to do. I was inspired to start this after seeing how amazing my 
                            friend <a id="miguel-tag" href="https://github.com/Kaweees">Miguel VF</a>'s <a id="miguel-tag" href="https://miguelvf.dev/">website</a> looked!
                            <br><br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So below are some notable things I've built or helped built. (*note: I am only really starting out so it may be
                            quite barren for a while.) 
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
